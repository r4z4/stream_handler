Hello there, this is going to be a long one because I want to see if it gets broken up. And then if that causes anything to fail or if it somehow just gets them all through, but I don't think that's gonna happen. I'm guessing that I will get some red stuff. Till we got, because it's just too many tokens. Although I do have batched brown, but I can't read of everything then or so. We'll take a look and we will see what we get with this. One minute and five second long recording full of voice stuff.
