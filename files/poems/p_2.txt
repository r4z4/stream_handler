The only way out seems to lead further in.
The more you succeed, the more you want more.
You are the loser each time that you win.

Of course, you'll be tempted at times to begin.
That's what the tokens and vouchers are for.
The only way out seems to lead further in.

So you take the free money and watch the wheel spin.
Your number comes up! It opens the door.
You are the loser each time that you win.

You know very well that your chances are slim,
Yet you crave the excitement in which your dreams soar.
The only way out seems to lead further in.

The everyday light of your life seems to dim
In the blare and the glare on the gambling floor.
You are the loser each time that you win.

When you're finally broke, and the future looks grim,
No worries! You'll soon all those losses restore.
The only way out seems to lead further in.
You are the loser each time that you win.
