I know it's only half a year
That you will be away,
But it will feel far more than that
Each long and lonely day.

A day without a friend is like
A meadow turned to sand,
A garden turned to weeds and dust,
An ocean far from land.

Time enters a slow-motion zone,
Repeating endlessly
The tearful grimace of the heart
Till you return to me.
