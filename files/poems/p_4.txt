Can't you see? Don't you care
I want to die?
Don't you listen? Can't you hear
My silent cry?

Won't you turn? Can't you hold
Me to your heart?
Are you afraid of what might follow
Once you start?

Would you rather not believe
I'm in such pain
That all your sense and good advice
Must be in vain?

Would you rather tell yourself
I'll be OK,
And all this adolescent angst
Will go away?

Ah! I would also swim across
This lake alone!
But if you cannot swim with me,
I know I'll drown.
