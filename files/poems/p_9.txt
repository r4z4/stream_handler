I'm sorry that I disappointed you
And did what I had promised I would not.
Mistakes can often teach someone a lot,
So please give me a chance before we're through.
Of all the punishment for my disgrace,
Regret at losing you has hurt the most.
Recall, I beg of you, this tearful ghost,
Yearning to return to your good grace.
