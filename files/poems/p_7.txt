Retirement requires a goodbye,
Entailing a sudden separation.
The wound is often deeper than the why:
In truth, an unexpected revelation.
Ravenous the passage of the years
Even as we spend the days together,
Meaning more than we can tell with tears,
Each entangled in the constant other.
Now you must go, and we remain behind;*
Ties so strong will not so soon unbind.

"Now I must go, and you remain behind;".
